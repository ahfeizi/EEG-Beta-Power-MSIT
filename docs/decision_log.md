# Decision log

Each entry is written **before** the analysis it governs is run. Entries are append-only.
If a decision changes later, add a new dated entry that supersedes the old one; never rewrite an old entry.

## S0-1 · 2026-10-02 · Stage 0 · Which OpenNeuro version of ds004621 is the local raw copy?

- **Question.** Does the current local raw copy match a published OpenNeuro snapshot, and which one? Audit item #14.
- **Inputs.** The current local raw copy (`bidsRoot`, see `get_paths.m`; read-only); OpenNeuro GraphQL metadata for snapshots 1.0.1, 1.0.2 and 1.0.3.
- **Procedure** (`revision/stage0/stage0_openneuro_version_check.py`):
  - for every `*task-rest*` and `*task-msit*` file of all 42 subjects, compare size and content hash with the snapshot metadata;
  - annexed files: SHA-256 against the `SHA256E` key;
  - non-annexed files: git blob SHA-1, computed in Python;
  - no git command is run in the raw folder.
- **Decision rule.**
  - **0 mismatches against exactly one snapshot:** the local copy is that version.
  - **Mismatches against every snapshot:** the copy is unidentified, and that is reported as a limitation.
  - **The EEG binaries (`.eeg`) are identical across all snapshots:** the version affects event markers only, not the signal.
- **Caveat stated in advance.** The analyses of July–August 2026 read an earlier local copy that no longer exists. This check identifies the current local copy only. Check S0-2 tests indirectly which marker version the existing derivatives contain.
- **Outputs.** `Revision_Output/stage0/openneuro_version_check_<tag>.txt`.

## S0-2 · 2026-10-02 · Stage 0 · Do the rest event markers survive in the existing `_rest_clean.set` files?

- **Question.**
  - Can the two S12-delimited 300 s rest blocks be recovered from the existing derivatives?
  - Which marker version did the derivatives inherit (sub-20 and sub-23 changed in v1.0.3)?
  - Additionally, for #15: the ICA dimensionality actually used.
- **Inputs.** `Rest_Output/sub-XX/sub-XX_rest_clean.set` (read-only). Only the variables `event`, `urevent`, `srate`, `pnts`, `trials`, `xmin`, `icaweights`, `nbchan` and `chanlocs` are loaded; the EEG data are not. Also `Rest_Output/full_qc_summary.csv` and the raw `*_task-rest_events.tsv`.
- **Procedure** (`revision/stage0/stage0_check_rest_markers.m`). For each subject, list:
  - the marker types and counts in `urevent` and in `event`;
  - the urevent latencies of S12, S10 and S11 in seconds, compared with `events.tsv` onsets;
  - the number of epochs;
  - the number of ICA components vs `nbchan` and `nBadChan`;
  - whether Fz, Cz or C4 was among the interpolated channels.
- **Decision rule.**
  - **All three marker types present with latencies matching `events.tsv` (within one sample at 500 Hz):** blocks can be recovered from the derivatives. This is information only; Stage 3 reruns from raw data anyway (decided).
  - **sub-20 or sub-23 marker sets matching the v1.0.3 `events.tsv`:** consistent with the analysis having used v1.0.3.
  - **Any other pattern:** reported as is.
- **Outputs.** `Revision_Output/stage0/rest_markers_in_clean_sets.csv`, `Revision_Output/stage0/rest_markers_log.txt`.

## S0-3 · 2026-10-02 · Stage 0 · Response-to-next-stimulus interval (RSI) in MSIT+

- **Question.** How long after the previous button press does the pre-stimulus window (−200 to 0 ms) start? This is the input for #6 (post-movement beta rebound) and for choosing a within-task comparison window in Stage 5.
- **Inputs.** `<bidsRoot>/sub-XX/eeg/sub-XX_task-msit_events.tsv` for all 42 subjects (read-only).
- **Procedure** (`revision/stage0/stage0_rsi_summary.m`).
  - For every stimulus event (`trial_type == "stimulus"`), find the most recent preceding response event (`trial_type == "response"`). RSI = stimulus onset − response onset.
  - Each stimulus is labelled:
    - with its condition (S5 = F0, S6 = FS, S7 = 00, S8 = S0);
    - by whether it is the first stimulus after an `S 11` / `S 10` / `S 12` marker (first-in-mini-block);
    - by whether the previous trial had **no** response before this stimulus (a missed response, or a response arriving after the next stimulus).
  - Also stored: SOA (stimulus-to-stimulus) and RT (stimulus-to-own-response; first response after the stimulus and before the next stimulus).
- **Descriptive only.** No inferential test, no conclusion about beta. The summary is per subject (median, IQR, min, max) plus pooled percentiles, and the proportion of trials whose previous response falls inside each of 0–0.5, 0.5–1.0, 1.0–1.5 and >1.5 s before stimulus onset.
- **Decision rule (how the output will be used, fixed in advance).** The window choice is deferred to Stage 5 and will be logged there before any spectral analysis. This output only describes the timing. Fixed now:
  - (i) trials whose previous response lies within the −200 to 0 ms window itself will be flagged for exclusion from any pre-stimulus window;
  - (ii) a post-movement beta rebound is commonly described as peaking roughly 0.5–1 s after movement offset (Kilavik et al., 2013, already cited). If the median RSI falls in that range, the Stage 5 design must model or match RSI.
- **Outputs.** `Revision_Output/stage0/rsi_per_trial.csv`, `Revision_Output/stage0/rsi_summary_per_subject.csv`, `Revision_Output/stage0/rsi_summary_pooled.txt`.

### Outcomes, Stage 0 (appended 2026-10-02 after the runs; the entries above are unchanged)

- **S0-1 → local copy = OpenNeuro v1.0.3.**
  - 420 rest and MSIT files checked: 0 mismatches against 1.0.3; 4 against 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 (the sub-20 and sub-23 rest `.vmrk` and `events.tsv`).
  - The `.eeg` and `.vhdr` files are byte-identical across all three snapshots, so the version affects markers only.
  - Full SHA-256 of all 84 rest and MSIT `.eeg` binaries also matches v1.0.3: 420/420 files MATCH (`openneuro_version_check_1.0.3_big.txt`).
- **S0-2 → the markers survive in all 42 `_rest_clean.set` files.**
  - The marker sequences equal the v1.0.3 `events.tsv` in every subject; latencies agree within 1 ms.
  - The derivatives carry v1.0.3-specific fingerprints: sub-20 `'S  12'` (two spaces); sub-23 has a boundary at the v1.0.3 "New Segment" sample. This is consistent with the original analysis having used v1.0.3.
  - **sub-25 has only `S 12 | S 12`** (no break markers) in both the raw file and the derivative. Block cropping for sub-25 needs a separate rule in Stage 3a.
  - Side findings for #15 and #9:
    - stored ICA dimension exceeds `nbchan − 1 − nBadChan` in 13 subjects;
    - Fz was interpolated at rest in 14 subjects, Cz in 3, C4 in 2 (17 subjects with ≥ 1 of the three).
- **S0-3 → within-mini-block RSI.**
  - Median 1.361 s (P5 0.967, P95 1.685); per-subject medians 1.241–1.481 s.
  - Under pre-stated rule (ii), the median RSI is **not** within 0.5–1.0 s, so RSI modelling is not mandated by that rule. Whether to add it anyway is a Stage 5 decision.
  - 6 stimuli have a response inside −0.2..0 s (flagged under rule (i)).
  - First-in-mini-block stimuli: 4773 of 16,729 (87–126 per subject).
